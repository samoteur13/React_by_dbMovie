## About

The "Liste de Films" project is a React-based web application for managing a list of movies. I developed this project during my training, particularly during my internship. This project represents my first experience with React. It utilizes the ["dbMovie" API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started) to fetch movie data and create an interactive movie list.

**Material-UI** was used for the user interface, providing a modern and user-friendly design.

I've also implemented a search filter, allowing users to search for movies by year, genre, or directly by movie title.
